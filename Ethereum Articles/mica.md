<h1>Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA): EU Regulatory Compliance Framework and What It Means for Crypto – Companies.</h1>
<h2> Author: Isaac Ijuo</h2>
<p> <b>Introduction</b> <br>
To give the crypto-market managed risk and integrity, stakeholders, traders, hodlers  and institutions with vested interest in cryptocurrency have long called for a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The concerns were amplified by the high-profile bankruptcies and liquidations of Tokens and exchanges such as Celsius Token,  Luna,  FTX exchange,  alongside countless of other projects that were either rug-pulled or abandoned. These failures have wiped out users’ funds, enabled fraud  and facilitated Money Laundering.  </p>
<p>The extent of the backlash and challenge is emphasized by statistics: between 2018 and 2023, illicit addresses received <em>$113 billion worth of cryptocurrency, and $93 billion was laundered using crypto between 2019 and 2023.</em> These figures cover crimes like fraud, sanctioned jurisdiction and entity, fraud shop and Off The counter (OTC), ransomware, and darknet activity, highlight the critical need for regulations. </p>
<p>Responding to these demands, the European Union (EU) has introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)  regulation to offer a regulatory guide, and market control. A part of the regulation came into force in 2023; however, this landmark legislation comes just over two years after the initial bill was proposed, representing a transformative step forward in the global regulation of digital assets.</p>

<p>As the first unified regulatory framework for crypto-assets, MiCA’s. MiCA lays out specific requirements to bring clarity and accountability to the crypto-asset market and its core objectives are: 

1) It mandates transparency in how crypto-assets are issued, offered to the public, and admitted for trading on platforms. 
2) The regulation also establishes authorization and supervision standards for crypto-asset service providers, as well as issuers of asset-referenced and e-money tokens, ensuring these entities operate with integrity and governance. 
3) To address market challenges and maintain user confidence which includes preventing market manipulation, unlawful disclosure insider trading and other abuses.  
4) To provide consumer protection by cautiously safeguarding users by enforcing transparency and clear communication using whitepapers and other marketing channels.  
5) The regulation seeks to support innovation and fair competition by making it easier for crypto businesses to comply whilst expanding. 

This article explores the scope, key compliance requirements, and the risks of non-compliance under MiCA, offering actionable insights for crypto businesses</p>

<h2>Scope of the Regulation:</h2>
<p>With the goal of regulating and establishing a uniform framework throughout the EU, MiCA’s scope encompasses a diverse range of digital assets and services. However, before discussing the specific types of assets and services within its regulatory jurisdiction, it is important to understand how MiCA defines a “crypto-asset.”</p>
<h3>What are Crypto-Assets as defined by MiCA?</h3>
<P>Crypto-Assets are digital representation of a value or of a right that is able to be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology or similar technology.  Representations of value include external, non-intrinsic value attributed to a crypto-asset by the parties concerned or by market participants, meaning the value is subjective and based only on the interest of the purchaser of the crypto-assets. When used as a means of payment, crypto-assets can present opportunities in terms of cheaper, faster and more efficient payments, in particular on a cross-border basis, by limiting the number of intermediaries.</P>

<h3>What are the Crypto-Assets Regulated by MiCA?</h3>
<p>MiCA categorizes crypto-assets into three main types based on their intended purpose, associated risk and how their value, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>E-Money Tokens:</b> 
<p>These crypto-assets aim to stabilize their value by referencing a single official currency, such as the euro or dollar. It functions like electronic money and serves as electronic surrogates for coins and banknotes and are predominantly used for payments (Directive 2009/110/EC describes as electronic money).</p>
</li>
<li><b>Asset-Referenced Tokens:</b> 
<p>As referenced by the regulation, this covers all other crypto-assets, other than e-money tokens. The token value aims to stabilize their value by referencing other assets,  which may include fiat currencies, commodities, or baskets of assets. These tokens are however distinct from e-money tokens and cater to a wide array of use cases while ensuring future regulatory applicability.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Other Crypto-Assets:</b>
<p>This category includes all other tokens that do not fall under the first two classifications. These could range from utility tokens,  which grant access to goods or services, to various innovative token types that do not have inherent stabilization mechanisms.</p>
</ol>

This classification system ensures that the regulation appropriately addresses the risks and functionalities associated with each type of crypto-asset, specifically apply rules and protections accordingly.

<h2>What are the Crypto-Assets Exempted by MiCA</h2>
<p>Despite its broad scope, MiCA excludes certain digital assets to focus on those with financial and economic implications:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><b>Unique and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)/ Non-Fungible Crypto-Assets (NFCAs):</b></li>
<p> The regulation mentions two unique asset classes (NFTs and NFCAs), representing unique digital assets such as art or collectibles, product guarantees, or real estate.  These assets derive their value from their distinct characteristics and the utility they provide to the holder, making them unsuitable for fungible trading or direct financial comparisons. While they may be traded on marketplaces or held for speculative purposes, their unique nature limits their financial application and minimizes risks to holders and the broader financial system.</p>

<li><b>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</b></li>
<p>Digital currencies that are issued and managed by central banks, acting in their monetary authority capacity, including central bank money in digital form, or crypto-assets issued by other public authorities, including central, regional and local administrations are also excluded by the regulation.</p>

<li><b>Non-Transferable Assets:</b></li>
<p> Digital assets that cannot be transferred to other holders or tokens limited to closed systems do not qualify as crypto-assets. Like loyalty points for a retailer or gaming tokens within a specific ecosystem, are also excluded.</p>
</ol>

<h2>Who does MiCA apply to?</h2>
<p>The MiCA regulation applies to different participants within the crypto-asset ecosystem, including both natural and legal persons’  directly or indirectly. These includes crypto-asset services such as custody, trading, issuance, and advisory functions, whether these are performed fully or partially in a decentralized manner.  The regulation also covers issuers of crypto-assets,  who create or manage tokens offered to the public or admitted to trading, as well as offerors and individuals facilitating trading on platforms.  It also applies to Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs),  including entities handling exchange, transfer, custody, and advisory services.</p>

<h2><b>Who should not worry about MiCA?</b></h2>
<p>MiCA excludes certain entities and activities from its scope, and they are:</p>

- Persons who provide internal crypto-asset services exclusively for their parent companies, subsidiaries, or related entities.
- Insolvency officials acting during insolvency procedures (except as specified in Article 47). 
- Central banks, such as the European Central Bank (ECB), other Member State central banks acting as monetary authorities, and public authorities. 
- International and EU financial entities like the European Investment Bank and its subsidiaries, the European Financial Stability Facility, the European Stability Mechanism, and public international organizations.
- Unique and non-fungible crypto-assets, such as digital art or collectibles that are not fungible with other crypto-assets.
- Crypto-Assets Covered by Other EU Regulations:
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Financial instruments. </li>
        <li>Deposits, including structured deposits.</li>
        <li>Funds unless they qualify as e-money tokens.</li>
        <li>Securitization positions as defined under Regulation (EU) 2017/2402.</li>
        <li>Non-life or life insurance products and reinsurance contracts covered by Directive 2009/138/EC.</li>
        <li>Pension products that provide retirement income under national law.</li>
        <li>Officially recognized occupational pension schemes as defined in Directive (EU) 2016/2341 or Directive 2009/138/EC.</li>
        <li>Individual pension products requiring employer contributions as mandated by national law.</li>
        <li>Pan-European Personal Pension Products as defined in Regulation (EU) 2019/1238.</li>
        <li>Social security schemes covered under Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and (EC) No 987/2009.</li>
    </p>
    </ol>
`<h2><b>What must crypto-businesses do?</b></h2>
<p>A better part of the regulation is already in force and it’s best that companies immediately start to comply with it. To comply with MiCA, organizations must implement different compliance mechanisms aimed at fostering openness, accountability, and market integrity within the crypto-asset ecosystem. And some of which are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The first step is always to evaluate whether your business activities or crypto-assets fall under MiCA’s scope of applicable entities and classify your assets accordingly (e.g., e-money tokens, asset-referenced tokens, etc.) as provided by the regulation.</li>
<li>Register with National Competent Authorities (NCAs), providing governance frameworks, financial reports, and operational details. </li>
<li>	The regulation now mandates crypto-businesses to draft a white paper, explaining your crypto-asset’s purpose, functionality, risks, and customers rights. The white paper and marketing communication should not contain unforeseen risk and should be fair, clear and not misleading and this should be submitted to NCAs before any public offering or trading.</li> 
<li>The regulation pointed out that issuers of asset-referenced tokens should establish strong governance frameworks, ensuring management meets competence,  and integrity standards while implementing risk management and disaster recovery plans. </li>
<li>All entities falling within the scope of the regulation must comply with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) regulation and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) financing rules, conducting customer due diligence and reporting suspicious activities. </li>
<li>Maintain fully backed reserves for stable coins, asset-referenced tokens and ensure CASPs hold sufficient capital buffers to manage operational risks, and the pools of reserves shall be managed separately. </li>
<li>To cover their liability against holders of asset-referenced tokens, issuers of asset-referenced tokens should constitute and maintain a reserve of assets matching the risks reflected in such liability. The reserve of assets should be used for the benefit of the holders of the asset-referenced tokens when the issuer is not able to fulfil its obligations towards the holders, such i.e. insolvency.</li> 
<li>Crypto-businesses are mandated to protect consumers by providing transparent information about services, pricing risks, and to establish accessible complaint-handling procedures, especially from holders of asset-referenced tokens,  and for clients of crypto-asset service providers.  Also, businesses must have a policy for the identification, prevention, management and disclosure of conflicts of interest. </li>
<li>	Prevent market abuse such as insider trading,  unlawful disclosure of inside information,  and market manipulation  by implementing monitoring systems and ensuring secure trading environments. </li>
<li>	As part of the compliance process, the consensus mechanisms used for the validation of transactions in crypto-assets might have principal adverse impacts on the climate and other environment-related adverse impacts. Such consensus mechanisms should therefore deploy more environmentally-friendly solutions and ensure that any principal adverse impact that they might have on the climate, and any other environment-related adverse impact, are adequately identified and disclosed by issuers of crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers. <br>

How do organizations determine whether adverse impacts are principal? Regulation provides that accounts should be taken of the principle of proportionality and the size and volume of the crypto-asset issued. In addition, when providing portfolio management of crypto-assets, crypto-asset service providers should provide periodic statements to their clients, which should include a review of their activities and of the performance of the portfolio as well as an updated statement on the suitability assessment. </li>
<li>Stay updated on regulatory developments from European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, ESMA) or NCAs and conduct regular operational audits to ensure ongoing compliance. </li>
<li>As an advantage, businesses can leverage MiCA’s cross-border framework to operate seamlessly across EU Member States without additional regulatory approvals. </li>
<li>Consult legal and regulatory experts to align your operations with MiCA’s requirements and navigate its complexities effectively. </li>

<h2><b>What Risks will Organizations suffer for Non-Compliance?</b></h2>
<p>Non-compliance with MiCA carries significant risks that can jeopardize a business’s operations, reputation, and market presence:</p>

- The regulation provides different degrees of financial penalties that may be imposed by NCAs, with fines proportional to the entity’s revenue or transaction size/turnover according to their financial statement. 
- Persistent violations can lead to operational bans, including suspension, loss of authorization, or prohibition from providing services in the EU. 
- Member States are permitted in accordance with their national law to issue public statements on the nature of infringement, order such an entity to cease from conducting such infringements and levy fines at least twice the profits gained, or losses avoided.  As regulations offers fine of  maximum at least seven hundred thousand Euro or Five Million Euro (€700, 000  or €5,000,000 ) for Member States whose official currency is not the Euro. This disclosure can cause reputational damage, deterring investors, customers, and partners.
- Failing to meet consumer protection standards can result in legal liabilities,  including claims or class-action lawsuits from affected clients and reserves must be available to service such claims.

<h2><b> Conclusion:</b></h2>
<p>MiCA represents a significant step forward in balancing regulatory rigor with innovation. By providing clear rules and fostering trust, the regulation creates a secure and transparent environment for digital assets. For crypto businesses, players, proactive compliance with MiCA is not just a necessity but an opportunity to thrive in a regulated and harmonized market.
