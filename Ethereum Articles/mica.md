<h2> Author: Isaac Ijuo</h2>
<p> <b>Introduction</b> <br>
To give the crypto-market managed risk and integrity, stakeholders, traders, hodlers  and institutions with vested interest in cryptocurrency have long called for a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The concerns were amplified by the high-profile bankruptcies and liquidations of Tokens and exchanges such as Celsius Token,  Luna,  FTX exchange,  alongside countless of other projects that were either rug-pulled or abandoned. These failures have wiped out users’ funds, enabled fraud  and facilitated Money Laundering.  </p>
<p>The extent of the backlash and challenge is emphasized by statistics: between 2018 and 2023, illicit addresses received <em>$113 billion worth of cryptocurrency, and $93 billion was laundered using crypto between 2019 and 2023.</em> These figures cover crimes like fraud, sanctioned jurisdiction and entity, fraud shop and Off The counter (OTC), ransomware, and darknet activity, highlight the critical need for regulations. </p>
<p>Responding to these demands, the European Union (EU) has introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)  regulation to offer a regulatory guide, and market control. A part of the regulation came into force in 2023; however, this landmark legislation comes just over two years after the initial bill was proposed, representing a transformative step forward in the global regulation of digital assets.</p>

<p>As the first unified regulatory framework for crypto-assets, MiCA’s. MiCA lays out specific requirements to bring clarity and accountability to the crypto-asset market and its core objectives are: 

1) It mandates transparency in how crypto-assets are issued, offered to the public, and admitted for trading on platforms. 
2) The regulation also establishes authorization and supervision standards for crypto-asset service providers, as well as issuers of asset-referenced and e-money tokens, ensuring these entities operate with integrity and governance. 
3) To address market challenges and maintain user confidence which includes preventing market manipulation, unlawful disclosure insider trading and other abuses.  
4) To provide consumer protection by cautiously safeguarding users by enforcing transparency and clear communication using whitepapers and other marketing channels.  
5) The regulation seeks to support innovation and fair competition by making it easier for crypto businesses to comply whilst expanding.

<h2>Scope of the Regulation:</h2>
<p>With the goal of regulating and establishing a uniform framework throughout the EU, MiCA’s scope encompasses a diverse range of digital assets and services. However, before discussing the specific types of assets and services within its regulatory jurisdiction, it is important to understand how MiCA defines a “crypto-asset.”</p>
<h3>What are Crypto-Assets as defined by MiCA?</h3>
<P>Crypto-Assets are digital representation of a value or of a right that is able to be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology or similar technology.  Representations of value include external, non-intrinsic value attributed to a crypto-asset by the parties concerned or by market participants, meaning the value is subjective and based only on the interest of the purchaser of the crypto-assets. When used as a means of payment, crypto-assets can present opportunities in terms of cheaper, faster and more efficient payments, in particular on a cross-border basis, by limiting the number of intermediaries.</P>
