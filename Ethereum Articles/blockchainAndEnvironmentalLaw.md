Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, as transformative innovations, have ignited widespread public interest and deepened engagement even among lawmakers, sustainability advocates, and environmental experts. Often time, the rise of crypto assets has been associated with a massive demand for electricity by crypto miners, thereby contributing to global warming. In particular, the ‘proof-of-work’ mechanism the common protocol to authenticate Bitcoin’s transactions, among other crypto assets is energy 'power' hungry and tends to demand more electricity as prices of crypto assets go up.<br><br>
At the center of this debate lies a critical question: <em>how sustainable are the consensus mechanisms, particularly the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model used by major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and, until recently, Ethereum?</em> This issue has prompted figures like Senator Ed Markey to voice concerns, tweeting, <i style="">“When one year of U.S. Bitcoin mining creates as many carbon emissions as 7.5 million gas-powered cars—we have a problem. Today's hearing made that even clearer. The crypto industry is growing, but so is the fight for climate justice. We will hold these companies accountable. ”</i>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Past CO2 Emissions from Crypto Mining</h2>
Data shows that in 2021 only, crypto mining comprised 0.9% of global electricity use and 0.33% of global emissions. At 220 terawatt per hour, in 2021, crypto mining demanded around as much electricity as Australia or Spain. One Bitcoin transaction required the equivalent electricity consumption of a typical individual from Ghana or Pakistan for 3 years. And in 2022, crypto mining and data centers accounted for 2 percent of world electricity, and metrics indicates that this is likely to increase by 3.5% in five years according to the International Energy Agency projections, this level of energy consumption will be equilavent to current consumption of Japan (the world's fifth largest electricity user).<br><br>
In 2024, according to live data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), only Bitcoin network’s estimated power demand is approximately 21.10 gigawatts (GW), where a gigawatt equals one billion watts of power . This translates to an annualized electricity consumption of 184.97 terawatt-hours (TWh), with a terawatt-hour representing one trillion watts consumed over the course of an hour, amazing right? This energy usage is comparable to the annual electricity consumption of mid-sized nations like Thailand  or Argentina. These highlights the significant energy demands of Bitcoin and crypto-mining, and indeed calls for the pressing need for energy efficiency to mitigate its environmental impact. <br>

Amid this growing concerns, Ethereum’s successful transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model represents a <em>"Eureka"</em> moment for blockchain sustainability. At the just concluded Ethereum Foundation Developers Conference South East Asia (DEVCON SEA) 7 at Bangkok in Thailand, the Ethereum Foundation confirmed that Ethereum now consumes over 99.95% less energy, making it the first major blockchain to achieve sustainability compliance.  This pivotal shift not only addresses long-standing criticisms of blockchain’s environmental impact but also sets a precedent for how the industry can align with global sustainability goals. 

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Brief Comparison of PoW vs. PoS </h2>

While PoW systems are energy-intensive by design, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) offers a more energy-efficient alternative. In PoS, validators are selected based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral, eliminating the need for computational competition, make the need for energy intense machines unnecessary. 

The differences between Pow and PoS are further examined in the table below.

<h2>Technical Overview of Ethereum’s Transition</h2>
Ethereum’s transition from PoW to PoS, known as The Merge, wasn't an overnight decision, it was a woven, multifaceted and multi year process, requiring several iterations, testing and analysis:
<ol type ="*">
<li>2017:</li> Ethereum's founder, Vitalik Buterin announced plans to transition to PoS.
<li>2020:</li> Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain launched laying the foundation for PoS by running alonside the existing Pow network.
<li>2022:</li> In September 2022 after years of research and development, "The Merge" officially took place combining the PoW and PoS into a single PoS-based Ethereum network.  The PoS model relies on validators staking their ETH (in this case 32 ETH) to participate in transaction validation. However, Vitalik mentioned at DEVCON that he looks forward to having a minimum of 1 ETH staking requirement for validators. 
</ol>
<h2>Environmental Impacts of Ethereum PoS</h2>
Indeed, the environmental benefits of PoS extend beyond energy efficiency. A lifecycle assessment of Ethereum reveals a reduced impact at every stage of its operation and it includes:

<ol type ="*">
<li> Hardware and Infrastructure:
As mentioned earlier, under PoW, Ethereum miners relied solely on expensive, energy-intensive hardware, however PoS eliminated the need for mining rigs, allowing validators to operate with general-purpose computers. This change brought about:<br>
- Decreased demand for specialized hardware.<br>
- Reduced e-waste from discarded mining equipment.<br>
- Allowed validators to use existing infrastructure, further lowering environmental impact.<br>
</li>
<li> Operational Efficiency:
With PoS, Ethereum’s operational energy requirements dropped dramatically. Validators no longer compete for computational dominance, and the network consumes a fraction of the electricity it once did. This improvement directly reduces the carbon footprint of Ethereum operations.
</li>
<li> Proper End-of-Life Management:
Before now, Blockchain networks often face criticism for their contribution to e-waste, through the disposal of non-recyclable  hardwares However, Ethereum’s PoS mechanism extends the lifecycle of hardware by removing the need for frequent upgrades.

<h2>Legal and Regulatory Dimensions</h2>
<img src="/Images/environmentandlaw.jpeg">

At the core of environmental law are critical principles that address climate change and emissions, energy use and resource management, and environmental justice. These pillars form the foundation of legal frameworks designed to mitigate environmental degradation while ensuring equitable access to natural resources. Side by Side, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize complementary sustainability objectives, including Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) , Climate Action (SDG 13) , Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) , and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17).<br> <br>Ethereum’s transition to PoS has significant implications for blockchain sustainability and policy development. Although at the moment, the environmental footprint of blockchain networks, especially those using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, has exposed significant gaps in existing environmental laws. Current frameworks often focus on centralized entities, overlooking decentralized systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum (pre-Merge). Laws governing energy use and emissions reporting struggle to account for the global and decentralized nature of blockchain operations, where mining activities may span multiple jurisdictions with varying environmental standards.<br><br>
Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) provides a concrete example of how blockchain networks can align with environmental regulations. By reducing its energy consumption by over 99.95%, Ethereum no longer contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This makes it a model for compliance with international climate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions across industries.

<h2> Lessons from Ethereum's Transition and Policy Recommendations </h2>
<img src="/Images/ethereum.jpeg">
Since the Ethereum Foundation is making strides to comply with global environmental standards and align with the United Nations definition of sustainability, governments and regulators now have a unique opportunity to foster sustainable blockchain practices on a broader scale. Drawing from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), policies can align with global sustainability objectives by incentivizing clean energy adoption and regulating the environmental impact of blockchain networks.
<br>
<ol type="1">
<li> Incentivizing Innovation:</li>
Policymakers can encourage blockchain networks to adopt renewable energy by:<br>

-	Offer tax breaks or grants to blockchain networks that adopt energy-efficient consensus mechanisms, like incentives for renewable energy adoption in other industries.<br>
-	Promote research and development into further advancements in blockchain efficiency, including hybrid models that reduce energy reliance.
<br>

<li>Establishing Global Standards for Emissions:</li>
Ethereum’s PoS model sets a benchmark for green blockchain practices. Governments and industry groups could create certification programs to:<br>

-	Implement standard reporting requirements for blockchain networks to disclose their energy consumption and carbon emissions, ensuring transparency.<br>
-	Create international agreements modeled after Ethereum’s PoS transition, encouraging other blockchain platforms to adopt sustainable practices.
- Recognize blockchain networks with low environmental impact and promote sustainable consensus mechanisms like PoS over PoW.
<br>
<br>

<li> Leveraging Ethereum’s Model:</li>

Ethereum’s PoS model sets a benchmark for green blockchain practices. Governments and industry groups could create certification programs to:
<br>

- Ethereum’s transition demonstrates the feasibility of shifting from PoW to PoS at scale, without compromising security or functionality. Regulators can use this as a case study to establish clear pathways for compliance, ensuring other blockchain networks follow suit.<br>
-  By integrating sustainability compliance into blockchain governance structures, platforms can align their operations with the SDGs and climate action goals.
